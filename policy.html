    	<h3>Policy</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
    	<p>Students are expected to attend class regularly.  If they are forced to miss a class, they are required to contact Mr. Stan Tate at 319-657-4200 or Mr. Dennis Shepard at 319-729-5503 at least one hour prior to the beginning of class.</p>
    	<p>Students have two or more unexcused absences will be dropped from the roles.</p>
    	<p>Students wanting to take a belt rank testing are required to attend all six classes prior to the scheduled belt rand testing, with one excused absence during the first 4 of those classes, and no absences at all allowed for the two classes prior to belt rank testing.</p>
    	<p>Some belt rand promotions involve attending church to receive the new belt and/or certificate.  These occasions are always announced far in advance.  All students are required to attend these promotional events, regardless or not whether they are receiving a promotion or not.  Students that know that they cannot attend the church belt presentation will not be allowed to test in that cycle.</p>
    	<p>Promotional testing is a full two-hour class, and all students are required to stay for the entire class, except for serious emergencies.</p>
    	<p>Uniforms are not required for training, but uniforms and work-out clothing must be clean, neat and not smelly.</p>
